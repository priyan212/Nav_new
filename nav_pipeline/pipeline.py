"""DINO -> NavDP navigation pipeline for the 6WD rover.

Per frame:
  1. Grounding DINO detects the text target -> bbox.
  2. Depth: external (Isaac Sim / sensor) or Depth Anything V2 metric (RGB-only).
  3. bbox + depth + intrinsics -> 3D point goal in the robot frame.
  4. NavDP samples N candidate trajectories conditioned on the point goal
     (checkpoint-native convention: y right-positive — empirically verified,
     see scripts/diag_goal_conditioning.py).
  5. Trajectory selection: combined score of goal progress (endpoint heading /
     distance toward goal) and the NavDP critic (collision safety). This keeps
     the rover goal-directed even though the extracted checkpoint's learned
     point conditioning is weak.
  6. Stop when the depth-estimated goal point is within stop_distance.

Returns a (linear, angular) velocity command plus rich debug info.

        detect() returns boxes sorted by score, but with several instances of

        objects frame-to-frame (viewing angle, partial occlusion). Each flip
        yanks the 3D goal to a different object and the rover lurches toward
        it. Prefer whichever box overlaps the previously tracked one (a
        greedy nearest-neighbor tracker) so the rover keeps heading toward
        whatever it first locked onto -- NOT whatever currently scores/looks
        closest. A single frame with no overlap (occlusion, edge clipping)
        doesn't concede the lock: it coasts (returns None, same as "not
        detected this frame") for up to lost_patience frames before falling
        back to a fresh top-score pick, so a momentary drop-out can't hand
        the lock to a different, often physically closer, object.

        motion (optional 2x3 affine, from _estimate_motion_affine -- no-op,
        exact prior behavior, if None): the reference box lives in the
        PREVIOUS frame's pixel space. If the camera panned/rotated since
        then, the same physical object shifts in the image even though
        nothing about the detection changed, and raw IoU against a stale
        reference can drop below the match threshold for no real reason.
        Warp the reference by the estimated camera motion before matching,
        so a same-object match under rotation isn't lost.

        rgb (optional -- no-op, exact prior behavior, if missing or
        use_appearance_reid is off): geometric IoU alone isn't enough in a
        room with several of the target class close together -- a
        NEIGHBORING same-class object can overlap the reference box on an
        ordinary tick (no miss ever counted, box never even coasts) and
        silently steal the lock outright, especially as the rover approaches
        a cluster and boxes drift/grow. Gate BOTH the ordinary IoU match and
        the lost_patience fallback on appearance (DINOv2 crop embedding
        cosine similarity, see PipelineConfig.appearance_min_similarity):
        the winning candidate must also look like the object we locked onto,
        or it's rejected (counted as a miss) instead of blindly accepted.

        initial_pick (optional): which detection to lock onto FIRST, overriding
        the plain top-score default -- e.g. from select_by_relation() when the
        target phrase named an anchor ("chair near the door"). Only consulted
        on the very first lock; once tracking, the same IoU/CMC/appearance
        machinery above takes over regardless of how the initial pick was made.
