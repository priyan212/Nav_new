"""Depth-based obstacle avoidance layers (model-agnostic, hard guarantees).

Three cooperating mechanisms, all fed by the metric depth image:

1. depth_to_obstacle_points: depth -> 2D obstacle points (x fwd, y left) in
   the robot frame, keeping only points in an obstacle height band (above
   ground, below overhead clearance). "Ground" is a LOCAL-SLOPE test, not a
   flat plane through the rover's own footing: each column is scanned from
   the closest row to the farthest, and a point counts as ground if its rise
   since the last confirmed ground point is within `max_climb_deg` over the
   distance traveled since then. A flat-plane assumption (fixed height
   threshold everywhere) reads a rising slope/hill as a wall, since the true
   ground climbs above that plane; but widening a FIXED-origin tolerance by
   range doesn't work either — at 1-2 m range the tolerance needed to admit
   a climbable slope is already as large as a real rock's height, so it goes
   blind to obstacles at exactly the range the hard-stop/slow-down thresholds
   below care about. Comparing against the local, walked-forward ground
   profile instead means cumulative slope height never matters (a rover can
   climb a slope of any total height) while a rock/step's abrupt LOCAL rise
   over a short distance still exceeds the tolerance and is still flagged,
   regardless of how far away it is. The target object's SAM mask is
   excluded so approaching the goal never counts as a collision.

2. swept_clearance: FOOTPRINT-AWARE clearance. The rover's 0.482 x 0.380 m
   rectangle is covered by two circles (radius 0.23 m at ±0.12 m along the
   body axis) and swept along every candidate trajectory using each
   waypoint's heading. Returned clearance is the gap BEYOND the hull —
   0 means the hull touches. Trajectories with gap < `margin` are vetoed.
   The current pose (0,0,0) is included so in-place rotation is also checked.

3. forward_guard: min obstacle distance inside the forward corridor ->
   hard stop below `hard_stop_dist`, linear slow-down below `slow_dist`,
   escape turn away from the obstacle side, and reverse-first escape when
   too close to rotate safely (half-diagonal 0.31 m > half-width 0.19 m).

4. apply_avoid_cooldown: purely reactive avoidance (recompute escape side
   fresh every tick, drop it the instant the corridor clears) is prone to a
   limit cycle: the rover escapes an obstacle on its right by turning left,
   clears hard_stop_dist, and goal-bearing servo immediately re-aims back at
   the same obstacle (since the goal is still past it) -> AVOID re-triggers
   -> turn left again -> repeat, with no net progress ("starvation"). This
   holds a bias toward the escape side for a few ticks after AVOID releases,
   so the rover actually drifts laterally clear of the obstacle's footprint
   before goal-seeking steering resumes at full strength.
